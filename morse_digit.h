\brief Three implementations of a function that converts a decimal
digit to Morse code.

These functions use a single 8-bit constant or small table of
constants to translate a number from 0 to 9 inclusive to the
corresponding Morse code.

/** 
Transmit a digit in Morse code for memory-limited applications.
This wacky stand-alone function for blinking out a single digit
from 0-9 in Morse code.
   - The function uses a single eight bit constant \c 0b111110 with
     arithmetic shifts as the Morse code table for the 10 values, 
   - The function depends on sign extension, and
   - The function fits in 80 bytes of ARM code.

\param digit is the actual digit 0-9, not ASCII.

Morse code for the digits:
Digit | Morse Code | Binary
-----:|:----------:|-------
    0 | `-----`    |\c 11111
    1 | `.----`    |\c 01111
    2 | `..---`    |\c 00111
    3 | `...--`    |\c 00011
    4 | `....-`    |\c 00001
    5 | `.....`    |\c 00000
    6 | `-....`    |\c 10000
    7 | `--...`    |\c 11000
    8 | `---..`    |\c 11100
    9 | `----.`    |\c 11110

This is a standalone function. It does not use the left-justified
encoding scheme described in the header file.

This routine takes 80 bytes.

I imagine this function as the gateway drug of Morse code
debugging.
*/void blinkMorseDigit(uint8_t digit);

// Two attempts at making blinkMorseDigit() shorter, weighing in at
// 96 and 104 bytes respectively.

/// Blink a single Morse code digit.
/// Implemented with a table lookup.
/// 96 bytes
void bmd096(uint8_t digit);

/// Blink a single Morse code digit.
/// Implemented implemented with a table lookup and the observation
/// that Morse(x) == ~Morse(x + 5) when x < 5.
/// 104 bytes
void bmd104(uint8_t digit);
